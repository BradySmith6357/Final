# BrewAtlas

BrewAtlas is a web-based application built using the MEAN stack. It was developed with homebrewers in mind, and is based off a simple design that allows for homebrewers to track their brewing history, develop exciting new beers, and earn rewards for brewing clone recipes from world-renowned breweries. 

# Problem Addressed

Homebrewing can be a disorganized process. Keeping track of your recipes can be cumbersome. BrewAtlas allows you to track your custom beer recipes from one location and store them for free in your own personal database.

# Status

BrewAtlas is currently in alpha and available for use at brewatlas.beer. Features, bugs and recipes are being implemented daily with plans to launch beta by the beginning of 2017.
